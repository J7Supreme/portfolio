                    <h2>About the project</h2>
                    <p>Ant has been working on inclusive finance starting in Southeast Asia countries for more than 5
                        years. In markets where digital wallets are popular ways of payment and somewhat go past card
                        payment among users, merchants can better engage users with digitalized marketing and tools.</p>
                    <p>After the Covid impact, cross border payments are back to stage and recovering fast. That is the
                        time Ant introduced Alipay+, a suite of cross-border digital payment and marketing solutions
                        connecting global brands with mobile-savvy consumers worldwide.</p>
                    <p>It is just like the network of digital wallets, out of the card payment world where we all know
                        the famous network names.</p>

                    <h2>My Role</h2>
                    <p>In the project, I worked with multi-disciplinary roles including sales, c-suites and shipped
                        complete experiences which are both customer and business facing. Those include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Customer facing unified payment experience</li>
                        <li>Customer facing Alipay+ center management portal in each local wallets</li>
                        <li>UX rules for merchants and agencies of integration</li>
                        <li>Sales enablement including sales kits</li>
                        <li>Related acquirer services experience</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Impact</h2>
                    <p>One thing worth mentioning is that all the key customer-end experience is based on all Ant's
                        previous efforts in making international payment possible on local wallet and ecommerce
                        platforms (Aliexpress, Lazada, etc.). I am the core product designer working on those for 3
                        years so basically the core functional parts (especially customer end) are done by me.</p>
