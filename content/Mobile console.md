REAL JOURNEY

Time taken

Oct 2023 - Apr 2024, total of 7 months



TITLE

Huawei Cloud Mobile Console App 

Empowering scattered cloud operation on the go with prioritized attention 



Context

The existing Huawei Cloud mobile console app was previously developed with a lot of mismatch from how users use it in real scenario. With lowering satisfaction rate compared its wide coverage of users, there is an organizational effort of bring up overall satisfaction rate and the app is planned for a revamp.

(can also mention the org is trying to incoporate AI on mobile)



The problems

Users are forced to operate cloud from tech stack perspective rather than business perspective.

This is due to technical development principle for a lot of cloud platforms from history legacy. And with role repsonsibility less specified, people who op cloud are not necessary cloud opes but application developers. They need a more natural angle.

The mobile app is positioned as a full-feature console on the go 

This caused a mismatch between real needs in mobile use cases.

Constraints

Far away from data and users

Hard to impact cloud IA and tech legacy



My scope and role

Coordinates connection for resoruces and data in HQ

Design research

Design concepts and principles

Design devliery



Key deisions

Update IA and introduce an overarching concept to filter data on the front end via tagging (front end tweak rather than backend revamp)   

Why - Within given time, it is not feasible to update the entire system to project based , thought its value has buy-in from product team as well. So we need to think about workaround to let user "see" data from that view. It is a tricky way to make user onboard first while we are still working on bigger scope changes

Solution - showing key flows from project based browsing to creating

Apply priority-based  customizable navigation flow that fits user's daily mental model

Why - mobile use cases vary from user to user, from role to role, and even from time to time. So applying a flexible structure which allows user to customize upon a pre-set common mindset based information sets are important. 

Solution - We identified a common pattern (from alert to details, from details to related info) across users and use that as the foundation for updated console home IA, and add customization modular design with triaging workflow.



Outcome

Handoff and work with developers on roadmap

Develop first version scope for Jul 30 realease

See an increase of CSAT score from  in 2 months

Ag satisfaction rate 85.15, NSS 58.1 versus 55.1 before revamp 



What i learnt

Working with dev across culture and pace: find multual benefits and workarounds to make sure each party gain credits for product

Working with users: Clearly position each platform and leverage the advatage to boost up instead of adding non-useful features. 

As platform experience, provide default set up for common mental model while remain flexibility for personalization in UX architecuture.
