# Designing for a disruptive payment network

Disruptive and systematic experiences across customer and business facing products for Alipay+, a suite of cross-border digital payment and marketing solutions.

## About the project

Ant has been working on inclusive finance starting in Southeast Asia countries for more than 5 years. In markets where digital wallets are popular ways of payment and somewhat go past card payment among users, merchants can better engage users with digitalized marketing and tools.

After the Covid impact, cross border payments are back to stage and recovering fast. That is the time Ant introduced Alipay+, a suite of cross-border digital payment and marketing solutions connecting global brands with mobile-savvy consumers worldwide.

It is just like the network of digital wallets, out of the card payment world where we all know the famous network names.

## Impact

One thing worth mentioning is that all the key customer-end experience is based on all Ant's previous efforts in making international payment possible on local wallet and ecommerce platforms (Aliexpress, Lazada, etc.). I am the core product designer working on those for 3 years so basically the core functional parts (especially customer end) are done by me.
