Huawei Agentic Cloud Console 

Defining how future users interact with Huawei Cloud in the agentic generation

CONTEXT

This project focuses on Huawei Cloud(HWC) Console, the core portal for enterprise users in various scale. As agentic capability grow, we see the fundamental restructure of cloud interface with cloud architecture the potential pivot point for HWC to surpass competitors.

PROBLEM / CHALLENGE

1.As customers grew in scale on HWC, they find the platform complicated to use for daily operation and monitoring. Services are getting better and diversed, but existing / classic console interfaces, even with AI, are static, passive, information overwhelming and still a lot of manual effort / attention needed. Current conversational UI for AI is just not sufficient.

2.In a future setting of agentic cloud, customers will meet amplified challenges of using and trusting the system for cloud domain. Even when the agentic level is L4~5, human will find it speculative and uncertain to work with.

CONTRAINTS

- US sanctioned tooling options (no access to leading design and AI tool)

- Uncertain and progressing of future cloud architecture

ROLE SCOPE

- Problem prioritization

- Design direction

- Design exploration and testing

- Delivery

- Cross department / region collaboration and alignment

KEY DECISIONS WITH SOLUTION

1. Expand user type from engineer to 1/2 level higher upstream users like app builder and even business owner.

2. Establish overall human like collaborator mental modal (autonomous + ambient in the loop)

	2.1 Omnipresent integration into daily tools for contextual output

	2.2 Collaborative

	2.3 Goal setting with self healing

3. Go beyond conversation UI to congnitive experience in cloud use case

	3.1 Project manangement like canvas UI for conversation navigation pattern 

	3.2 Mix of generative UI with fixed UI 

4. * Adopt AI in UX process

	4.1 Went in a very narrow list and find Tempo.ai as the vibe designing tool

	4.2 Integrate it in the process and upgrade AI driven UX process, for all roles

	(download the code and put it somewhere centric)

SOLUTION DEMO

Overall IA and key pages

Omnipresent

Goal setting and self healing

Intent space

Artifacts

Collaborative

IMPACT

Lock implementation for key pattern

Improvement in UX efficiency with the introduction of AI tool flow in concept phase (data)

	- AI for UX process from research, to ideating, to concept and to delivery

	- Build 7 testable prototypes within 4 days

REFLECTION

*but also do not emphasize too much on not leveraging Figman
