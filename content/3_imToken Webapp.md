# imToken Webapp
 Web3 | 0-1 Product

imToken Webapp is a web-based application built with smart contract, allowing everyone to have equal, quick and interactive access to tokens. It is part of imToken's vision as traditional crypto wallet provider, to bridge the gap between web2 and web3. 
I was the sole designer for this project from scratch, and had worked on transforming business intent to design strategy, IA and final delivery.

Here are a few key highlights.

## 1. The Foundation: Token-centric Initiative

**Design Rationales**
Starting from the internally aligned **Token-centric initiative**, the design was driven by the core insight that "Tokens are a new data format" (comparable to text, images, or video) carrying intrinsic value.

*   **Tangibility ("Spatial" & "Physical")**: To make tokens feel "real" rather than just numbers on a screen, I adopted a "Can see, can touch, can feel" approach. This involved exploring 3D and 2D visuals where specific shapes, geometries, and "uni-body" integrations (combining company logo with token icons) give tokens a physical presence.
    *   *Example: The spatial interactions flowing from the home page to collections and token details.*

*   **Visual Consistency for Identification**: To help users navigate the millions of available tokens, the design establishes a consistent classification system. By utilizing shape, color, pattern, and animation, users can intuitively identify and distinguish between different token types (Fungible, NFT, SoulBound).
    *   *Example: The brand splash loading animation.*

## 2. Accessible decentrazation for everyone
**Design Rationales**
*   **Just-in-Time Access**: Adopting the "Open Web" strategy (Web Browser + Connection = Access) to eliminate the friction of pre-installing wallet apps, with account abstraction based on smart contract, no more seed phrase memorization or backup. 
    Example: Sign up demo 

*   **Permissionless Interaction**: Enabling a "Claim via Link" flow where users can receive value immediately, bridging the gap between Web2 behaviors and Web3 technology. Link can also be easily made tangible in a variely of forms like NFC tag, QR code and more blend in real life scenarios like red pocket or secret evenlope. This made tokens 0 barrier to acess, interact and spread.
    Example: Claimable link and its red pocket variant 
    Example: NFC tag real life demo



## 3.  Scalable hub for a wallet/dapp combination
Through multiple iterations, webapp has become more than a wallet, it is a hub for token related activities in the form of "dapp". That's why I later worked on a sustainable and scalable design system that gradually defines element, component, IA rules, etc. to support the growth of the product.

**Design Rationales**
*   **Scalable Architecture**: Starting with a focused wallet utility while building an Information Architecture (IA) ready to expand into a multi-vertical hub (Staking, Cards, DApps).
    Example: Open standard external connection with other dapps as a wallet
*   **Unified Design System**: Creating a flexible design language that can accommodate diverse functional modules under a single cohesive brand usage.
    Example: Static demo of page rules, responsive rules and color themes


## 4. Impact 
**Impact:**
* It is in beta and now has become the launchpad for imToken's web strategy, which host all the new applications like staking, new imToken card, campaign, etc.
