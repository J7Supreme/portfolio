Overview

Rivo envisions a world where people can achieve daily financial goals leveraging the most convenient and secure blockchain technology.Born with the innovative DNA, it’s a platform to connect users’ digital assets to the real world transactions, with the values of Customer first, Reliable and secure, Open& Innovative, Affordable.

Payment has been complicated, despite of recent years’ innovations and integrations of big legacy systems. Rivo wants it to be simple, to be “Apple-like” and like the stream of its brand, to be smooth.
Minimum education results from an experience that is finacially intuitive, which is called Fintuitive.

Working inside imToken app, Rivo is going to not only serve imToken but also serve many more other services like imToken. There are clear segregations while still some connection.

 

Design keywords

We abstract and break down all the important aspects from business goals and transform them into user-language keywords, which guide the end to end design.

 

Key guidelines

All the keywords above will pratically guide designers across Rivo iterations.

 

Motivation > Distraction
In each step of the payment process, though there are still inevitable distraction like switching from app to app, lack of trust at first, system pending, etc, we need to add certain motivation to keep user focused, and prevent them from leaving. From biz point of view, this is also important for conversion. This motivations could come from a proactive interaction that is similar to the real life financial behaviour, or a proactive interaction that provides sense of security.

 

End to end in context

Payment does not begin with payment and end with payment result. The moment user walks into a convenient store and notice the Rivo sticker on the counter has already began the payment process. We need to think comprehensively about each touchpoint in the “Rivo service” and take them into experience consideration.

 

Clear and simple

Less is more, this is especially true during new product launch. There are only few seconds for new users to understand Rivo and its value. So each touchpoint design should be simplified.

 

Future ready

We design the service ready for potential future tech integration and device adaption, both to enrich and enhance experience. 
Two key elements from above directions:
The interactive dialog: the user interface port ready to connect with AI service and therefore connect user timely and informatively with ongoing tasks for smooth completion.
Multi form factor ready: Modular and content-oriented design, to be easily adapted with other devices than mobile phone.

Users interact with the UI*, UX, content, motion, service (all design elements) that deliver them the message that this service is backboned by web3 technology and now shaped in web2 format.

Service  function & value  intro section

Blockchain - why does it matter?

Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT). Ledger is a fundamental part of the accounting system to track and monitor the financial activity

Blockchain simultaneously records transactions and transfers value, simplifies the reconciliation and settlement process which is often complex in traditional legacy payment systems

Blockchain's decentralized nature ensures that it is secure, transparent, and resistant to tampering. 

RIVO network - future ready, tokens ready

As the world is still largely fiat-base, RIVO provides e-money ledger accounts to handle fiat transfer between buyer and sellers

Powered by blockchain, RIVO network is created to be ready when the world adopts digital tokens as mainstream currencies

Coming soon - imToken with RIVO

Enjoy convenient fiat payment* right at imToken app

CURIOUSITY FULFILLED

This section features on detailed intro with highlighed functionality of Rivo. Will be divided into several pieces to act as proof and details for the hero section.

Key presentation:

As RIVO is using layer two, good to depict the 2 layers concept. Layer 2 ( top ) is for fast transactions; Layer 1 ( bottom ) is the validation layer

 Biz background
As part of RIVO use case, from a merchant POV, they will need to accept payment from customers who has RIVO in hand. In early stage, we are enabling small amount of merchant to be able to easily accept payment via their handy devices like mobile phone and pad, where QR code containing payment info (payment amount, merchant info) is generated after merchant’s input. 

By doing this, we can really streamline merchant’s experience and process and get the business running more efficiently. 

*Key biz metrics: payment sr

Below is a breakdown of happy path. All error cases will be discussed in detail after happy path design.

A. RIVO’S VISION

The stream branding of Rivo is vibrant, moving and continously transforming. It represents Rivo’s vision of a world where people can achieve daily financial goals leveraging the most convenient and secure blockchain technology. With that in mind, Rivo should and must provide an experience that is equally smooth, moving and transforming, just like the steam or wave. It carries users' financial assets to flow through different process, making them realize their value in whatever devices are available in the future. Water flows with no shape.

 

B. IMTOKEN’S MISSION 

imToken as the world’s leading decentralized crypto wallet, aims to make digital assets under users' control. When it comes to digital payment, it’s still the same. The world of crypto is embracing more and more users that are previously not that tech-savvy or geeky. However, in the market, products are still very difficult to use. Just like any new products or services are that evetually becoming mainstream, the lowered barrier is a must which in its core should be an intuitive experience.  That intuitive is a keyword of imToken’s mission.

 

C. WEB 3.0 

Each new revolution results in a different era, where people think and do differently.3.0 is a huge step forward compared with WEB 1.0 as read-only single direction interaction, and WEB 2.0 as multi-media mutual direction interaction. In WEB 3.0. where users and data are decentralized and securely protected. Service providers should think about reach out proactively and interactively to users more instead of them reaching out. 

 

 

HOW IT LOOKS AND WHERE IT APPEARS
 

HOW IT LOOKS

The interactive dialog box  will appear in the form of a “dialog box “ close to any related content or objects in mobile screen. However, in the future it will also scale to other devices in similar forms with key branding elements from Rivo.

 

WHERE IT APPEARS

It appears mainly on Rivo home page, but also across all pages in Rivo journey.

 


Mainly appear in Rivo home page 

Appears in payment result layer

Difference cases of dialog box
 

CASE DEFINITIONS AND STRUCTURES
 

Key difference between the interactive dialog with an ordinary notification bar is the whether the case is “user behaviour triggered“ or “system triggered“

How different msgs are prioritized(展示规则):

There are 3 levels of prioritizations for all msgs.  

Prioritization does not equal Catogory.(meaning that there could be different Ps in one category)

High P will replace lower P when it needs to display.

Lower P will not replace high P if there is already a high P msg in display.

For same P msgs, displayed by time (new msg replaces older msg)

Initial problem analysis
 

question mark Problem statement from users
For an imToken user, he/she is unfamiliar with a new feature called Rivo in imToken app, and  is cautious to start using.

For a registered Rivo user, he/she does not know how to use the product at first.

For a registered Rivo user, he/she might get lost in the top up process where it requires switching between different apps and fails.

For a top-up Rivo user, he/she does not know where to use Rivo and how to make payment.

User’s onboarding & sign up needs a reverse step from common practice which shows password first and then OTP (due to SDK structure and future impelentation , as well as the fact that session token is not available in a lot of cases, leading to us not able to tell user’s status)

collision Thinking and Explanation in design exploration
OVERALL DESIGN
Q:How to deliver a post-DPT experience like dev do underneath?

A: Experience design has several layers, of which there is the surface layer and underneath layer. Surface is what user can look, touch and feel, and that is something we deliver directly to users. At the same time, the structure of information beneath that is a layer that users dont feel in a obvious way.

Post DPT, we can do more things that pure fiat transaction and our value proposition to users shines more. That is more reflected on the surface layer experience which brings the direct impression. What we can do to make sure that we support post DPT functions is on underneath layer.

As whole, the 2 layers should convey the consistent brand characteristics through different stages.

This will largely impact the design of followings:

Look and feel, Content:  Rivo homepage, Onboarding

Process: Top up?, Payment

For other process like sign up and log in, they won;t be that different.

Supporting: Check all those DPT holders' apps' process, as well as the crypto apps. Those cultvate users' behaviour.

 

ONBOARDING & HOMEPAGE
Q:How to let users understand the relationship and connection between imToken and Rivo?

A: We go from stage by stage. Still, there has to be a CONNECTION for users to FEEL, which means that users dont go directly into a FIAT payment world without any EXPECTATION or MOTIVATION. 

Looking forward, the connection is still important cuz anyway we will march into the crypto-fiat payment stage, so users need to have that feeling at first that these stages are connected. It’s not like they see a XXpay in crypto world(not using GrabPay because that has a brand image), and then the XXPay becomes available for using crypto. It should be they see some fiat feature that can be linked to crypto world (UI, marketing, promotion, content).

 

 

Q:How to engage user to verify their imToken password when activating Rivo, without them concerning about security?

A: For these group of users. they are sensitive. So avoid using any design that shows the meaning of TRANSMISSION, EXCHANGE, etc. Instead, make them feel that the password is to protect themselves. 

From a sign up process point of view, adding that little bit of feeling of opportunity cost, may let me make decision fast.

 

 

Q:How to design a smooth and faster user experience in payment?

A: Basically, without all the substantial tech and structure wise change, design can only use different interaction status to MAKE USER FEEL AS IF ITS FAST. 

Getting down to executions, some TEMPORARY modules, will make user feel FASTER than whole page modules. Layers, pop-ups are some examples.

Another way is to distract user while waiting, adding ads, marketing, or educations can benefit.\

EXAMPLES can be made within iOS, like applepay vs safari in terms of page display.
