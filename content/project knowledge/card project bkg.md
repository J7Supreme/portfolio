Competitor Experience
Key insights
Main use cases

Used for opening US services (one-time/subscription) , like OpenAI, AppStore

Used for services and digital payment in China, like binding to Alipay, Wechat, Taobao and food delivery services (Taobao charges 3% for all txn, Alipay charges 0 when txn amount below 200CNY, and 3% when above 200 CNY, Wechat charges 0 for all)

Used for cross-boarder shopping (like on US amazon)

Consider context for these cases

User need to input billing address (onekey provides it, dupay direct user to use third party address generator)

CVV and card no. info are frequently used

 

Help center

User would contact help center or CS quite often as card frozen and other issues are more frequent than ordinary cards

Fees

User cares e2e fees as first/second priority (along with use cases) when choosing among card options

KYC

Some users are sensitive to KYC

Card manage

Related functions are useful when user need to set/reset PIN, freeze, or set other advanced features (e.g. daily limit)

Appendix B - Wallet and Card IA Discussion
imToken Wallet App plans to conduct a overall change of the wallet information architecture (IA) in v2.15.0, this will also affect user’s experience to use imToken Card feature. Wallet IA discussion content has been added to this doc 2.15.0 信息架构 - 策略讨论会
  

Therefore, documenting the workin in progress information in the appendix until finali design is confirmed and to be added to the PRD.

Solution 1
Payment Wallet to be created at “Wallet” level and will be used to control all relevant payment instruments (including imToken Card)

The payment instruments will be listed in parallel at “Account” level under the Payment Wallet

Solution 2
Payment Account to be created at “Account” level and will need to be appended to an existing wallet

The payment instruments will be listed in parallel at within the Payment Account pages and they will not be visible in the account switch tab

Comparison of the Solutions
There are a couple of cases that will elaborate the differences between the 2 solutions:

Default entrance of imToken Card
Solution 1:

Payment Wallet to be displayed at Wallet level

imToken Card entrance to be displayed under the Payment Wallet


Solution 2:

Adding imToken Card to be included in the “Add Account” options

 

Entrance display of imToken Card after successful registration
Solution 1:

imToken Card identifier to be displayed


Solution 2:

imToken Card identifier will not be shown at account switch tab

Consider add small indicator on top of the banner

 

Switching the pairing relationship between the imToken Card and imToken Wallet
Solution 1:

“Payment” section will not change

Pairing info will only be displayed within the instrument, not visible at account switch page (consider add additional pairing indicator at this page? dotted line between Wallet and “Payment” section?)

Solution 2:

“Payment” Account to be displayed under an existing wallet

Switching the pairing relationship will cause “Payment” Account to be shown under different wallet

Display of multiple payment instruments under the Payment Account (RIVO account)
Solution 1:

Multiple payment instruments (imToken Card/RIVO e-money account…) will be shown in parallel under the “Payment” Wallet

Solution 2:

Multiple payment instruments (imToken Card/RIVO e-money account…) will not be visible at account switch page, to be shown once enter the payment account page

Display of multiple Payment Account (RIVO account)
Solution 1:

Multiple Payment Wallet will be displayed in parallel at “Wallet” level

Solution 2:

Multiple Payment Account will be appended to the existing wallet that it pais to
