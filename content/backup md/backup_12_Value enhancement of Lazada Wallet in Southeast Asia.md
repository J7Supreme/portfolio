# Value enhancement of Lazada Wallet in Southeast Asia

Delivering meaningful values to users from visibility to actual usage, driving wallet adoption and transaction growth.

## About the project

Lazada is the leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia with a user base of tens of millions. Lazada Wallet is the built-in digital wallet that allows users to top up balance and bind different financial assets to boost payment process and enjoy exclusive promotions.

But as the payment market in Southeast Asia is very fragmented, with almost more than 10 payment methods in each country. And a large portion of users are not bank account ready, so they find it hard to accept and enjoy the values by digital wallet.

## Product and goals

There is a pathway by Alipay with Taobao in China market which Alipay is trying to duplicate to SEA markets. The overall proportion of wallet transaction is still very low so the most urgent business need is to attract more users to activate and use it in daily shopping.

## User problems

In an end to end product check with other roles, though multiple iterations have been implemented to optimize Lazada wallet itself, we found that users just don't have enough awareness of it, not to mention all the values that come with it:

- The entry in as-is Lazada app for wallet is in a tiny space under "my" tab
- Most existing users get to use wallet because of promotional message in home page banners or noticing payment option in checkout

## Exploration and results

We tried two design methods in parallel for visibility and functionality.

Firstly, we expose wallet entry with values for user education and attraction. All the values came from previous research in each country and are specific tailored and configurable. Plus, a dedicated animation is implemented carrying 3 different messages to stand out.

Secondly, we practiced and keep optimizing core payment experience with wallet. Shortened steps for top up funds and then pay are now top up and pay directly. Even more, we inject payment directly into checkout process, to make one-tap checkout possible in Lazada.

The final result turns out great. We saw numbers of orders placed with Lazada wallet DOUBLED after 3 months.
