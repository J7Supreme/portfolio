# Huawei Cloud Mobile Console App
**Empowering scattered cloud operation on the go with prioritized attention**

---

## 1. The Challenge
**Mismatch between mobile constraints and full-feature ambition.**
The existing Huawei Cloud mobile console app was previously developed with a lot of mismatch from how users use it in real scenario. With lowering satisfaction rate compared its wide coverage of users, there is an organizational effort of bring up overall satisfaction rate and the app is planned for a revamp. (can also mention the org is trying to incoporate AI on mobile)

**The problems:**
1.  Users are forced to operate cloud from tech stack perspective rather than business perspective. This is due to technical development principle for a lot of cloud platforms from history legacy. And with role repsonsibility less specified, people who op cloud are not necessary cloud opes but application developers. They need a more natural angle.
2.  The mobile app is positioned as a full-feature console on the go. This caused a mismatch between real needs in mobile use cases.

**Constraints:**
*   Far away from data and users
*   Hard to impact cloud IA and tech legacy

**Role Scope:**
*   Coordinates connection for resoruces and data in HQ
*   Design research
*   Design concepts and principles
*   Design devliery

## 2. Key Strategies & Decisions
**Strategy:**
Move from technical orientation to prioritized attention.

**Strategic Principles:**
*   **Update IA and introduce an overarching concept to filter data on the front end via tagging (front end tweak rather than backend revamp):**
    *   *Why:* Within given time, it is not feasible to update the entire system to project based , thought its value has buy-in from product team as well. So we need to think about workaround to let user "see" data from that view. It is a tricky way to make user onboard first while we are still working on bigger scope changes.
    *   *Solution:* Showing key flows from project based browsing to creating.
*   **Apply priority-based customizable navigation flow that fits user's daily mental model:**
    *   *Why:* Mobile use cases vary from user to user, from role to role, and even from time to time. So applying a flexible structure which allows user to customize upon a pre-set common mindset based information sets are important.
    *   *Solution:* We identified a common pattern (from alert to details, from details to related info) across users and use that as the foundation for updated console home IA, and add customization modular design with triaging workflow.

## 3. Impact & Reflection
**Outcome:**
*   Handoff and work with developers on roadmap.
*   Develop first version scope for Jul 30 realease.
*   See an increase of CSAT score from  in 2 months. Avg satisfaction rate 85.15, NSS 58.1 versus 55.1 before revamp.

**What i learnt:**
*   **Working with dev across culture and pace:** Find multual benefits and workarounds to make sure each party gain credits for product.
*   **Working with users:** Clearly position each platform and leverage the advatage to boost up instead of adding non-useful features.
*   **As platform experience:** Provide default set up for common mental model while remain flexibility for personalization in UX architecuture.
