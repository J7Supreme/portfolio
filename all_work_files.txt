                    <h2>About the project</h2>
                    <p>AliExpress is second leading cross-border e-commerce platform in Europe, especially in countries
                        like Spain, France, Poland, Italy. With online business and user numbers meeting barrier, AE is
                        looking for ways to grow its business out of the online world.</p>
                    <p>Unlike China and many Asian countries, online retailer only makes up a very small portion of all
                        retailer business and people still conduct their "offline consumer behavior" a lot. The company
                        is hoping to leverage offline consumer acquisition and convert them to online AliExpress users
                        with promotions.</p>

                    <h2>Product and goals</h2>
                    <p>To connect physical stores to online business, one of the key connections are funds. Alipay as
                        the affiliated company with AliExpress, has got licence with its Luxembourg entity and has got
                        existing merchant coverage. Therefore the company planned to launch an e-wallet built in
                        AliExpress to help absorb offline consumer to online business.</p>

                    <h2>User problems</h2>
                    <p>Before moving on with design, the business strategy faces some obvious user challenges:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For any new product, or more specifically, an e-wallet, the first thing comes to users is
                            "Why this?". Users are sensitive to financial product.</li>
                        <li>Even though wallet penetration in each country is not low, but there are still majority of
                            people who hasn't had digital wallet experience before.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Research and exploration</h2>
                    <p>Me and the team (a group of 2, me as UX the other as UI) clearly understands what's blocking and
                        with that alignment, we started with desktop research and then reached out the research team for
                        a in-depth field research with us all travelling to Spain, France and Italy.</p>
                    <p>Desktop research focused on country specific basic facts, market general facts, and digital
                        wallet design trends. Field research focused on end to end journey, local users' mental model,
                        prototype testing, and users' diary studies.</p>

                    <h2>Design principles and results</h2>
                    <p>After rounds of discussion and iteration, the team decided to focus on building a fast trust by
                        relieving users' alertness and lowering the cost of cognitive:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Leverage existing brand trust from AliExpress</li>
                        <li>End to end visibility and education</li>
                        <li>Simplified and straightforward home design</li>
                        <li>Simplified onboarding and KYC</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Though the Euro 2020 was postponed, we still manage to attract a lot of offline store users as
                        the brand new users for AliExpress and throughout the whole year, completed the Annual active
                        user number by 170% of original goal in 2019.</p>

                    <p>Before covid, an approximate number of 30 million foreigners entered China every year, to travel,
                        do business or study. International payment issuers, like Visa and Mastercard is not widely
                        supported as China jumped over to mobile payment directly with mega player Alipay and Wechat
                        Pay.</p>
                    <p>These enormous group of users need to make payment in China in every way. Alipay aims to provide
                        seamless service for these foreign users to quickly adopt Alipay while not forcing themselves to
                        change any transaction habits.</p>

                    <h2>Challenge</h2>
                    <p>It was not only a war with competitor, but also a challenge within its organization:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Alipay has over 1 billion Annual Active Users while target user number for international
                            service is somewhere over 30 million</li>
                        <li>Alipay makes a majority of its revenue from domestic users and business</li>
                        <li>Alipay's as-is for international users are really poor</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To avoid the back and forth with domestic team on changing their system and flow, the business
                        team came across a brilliant idea of creating a dedicated app called TourPass.</p>

                        principles to optimize the service. Starting with current data dashboard, I dived deep with
                        customer service team on all the accurate user feedback and then move to understand the
                        financial context of these users in an international scenario.</p>
                    <p>A detailed list of principles were then abstracted: Customized, Educated, Trustworthy,

                        TourPass rose by 21% and complaint rate dropped by 48% (by month). We created a roadmap
                        together, with which I also created some guidelines and library for future team use.</p>

                    <h2>About the project</h2>
                    <p>2020 was a devastating year for most people, with the covid almost blocking normal lives of
                        people. It was also terrible for most business, as offline transaction nearly dropped to zero
                        during lockdowns.</p>
                    <p>Alipay+ Rewards is a sub-brand of Alipay+, a global cross-border payment solutions that not only
                        ease transactions, but also boost and help merchants to better engage customer for sales. The
                        goal is to quickly launch sites within each partner local ewallets and gain active users.</p>

                    <h2>Problem and challenges</h2>
                    <p>For a new product targeting in other countries, though there are collaboration with roles based
                        there, the whole design team is based in Shanghai, China. No initial data, no user feedback, no
                        updated knowledge about local users behavior, even no access to local competitors for a lack of
                        local phone cards, and mostly importantly, no travelling to those countries during Covid for
                        research.</p>
                    <p>It is the worst working environment I can think of for a global design team. Hiring local
                        designers? We did not have the budget.</p>

                    <h2>Approaches</h2>
                    <p>My role in this project was a bit different from my previous ones, as I would be the one to
                        oversee the design team with my previous experience and connections working on pure payment
                        products in these countries.</p>
                    <p>Starting from breaking down all the pain points, I abstract all the elements needed for a good
                        localized design. These elements later became my core directions to solve the problems and
                        together they created a sort of "holographic" environment for design team to work in.</p>
                    <p>In the later stage, I managed to develop a working mode of working with local agencies in mixed
                        mode. To help free designers to some extent, with local designers in charge of part of the
                        design output/expressions, while design team in China act as the "brain" to input core design
                        structures.</p>

                <section class="content-section">
                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>The team successfully changed users mindset and impression of the brand by delivering an
                        intriguing promotion service to them. In the later built NPS system, we also see a prominent
                        rise in promoters.</p>
                    <p>Throughout 2021, we updated the home page of Alipay+ Rewards in each wallet, held a mega campaign
                        in 11.11, and established a brand with mascot that are acknowledged by millions.</p>
                    <p>Internally, I prepared the whole team a design work structure for any kind of overseas design in
                        the future. The connections that we used are all kept in our design library and later helped the
                        Alipay+ project in 2022.</p>

                    <p>Ant has been working on inclusive finance starting in Southeast Asia countries for more than 5
                        years. In markets where digital wallets are popular ways of payment and somewhat go past card
                        payment among users, merchants can better engage users with digitalized marketing and tools.</p>
                    <p>After the Covid impact, cross border payments are back to stage and recovering fast. That is the
                        time Ant introduced Alipay+, a suite of cross-border digital payment and marketing solutions
                        connecting global brands with mobile-savvy consumers worldwide.</p>
                    <p>It is just like the network of digital wallets, out of the card payment world where we all know
                        the famous network names.</p>

                        years so basically the core functional parts (especially customer end) are done by me.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>In the project, I set my feet in all local markets, utilizing localized user insights and

                    <p>Outside the credit card dominated world, 17% people worldwide and 67% in Southeast Asia are
                        unbanked. With e-commerce bringing products to them, the last connection before logistics is
                        payment. With vastly varied local financial environment and payment methods, Ant Group aims to
                        connect local users with their preferred payment experience.</p>
                    <p>These payment methods include: Cash on delivery, Store payment, Bank debit, Online banking,
                        E-wallet, Voucher payment, and more.</p>

                    <h2>Challenges and approaches</h2>
                    <p>The team knew very little about local users' behavior and payment habits. With existing payment
                        methods suffering from low success rate, data itself cannot tell all the reasons for
                        improvement.</p>
                    <p>For each market and each payment method that I was involved, me and my team started by
                        understanding more about the country and users:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>E2E conversion rate break down and analysis for transaction</li>
                        <li>Regional demographic and ethnographic research and built country specific profile</li>
                        <li>Recruited users and conduct field research & in-depth user interview locally</li>
                        <li>Design sprint w/ users and internal stakeholders for journeys, pains and solutions</li>
                        <li>User validation with prototypes locally</li>

                        The team worked hard to locate key LOCAL TRUST element in user experience and leveraged it to

                        upgrade Cash on delivery method in Lazada to ewallet option and increase its transaction by
                        5.01%. In Brazil, I optimized experience of Boleto method and increase its success rate by
                        4.01%.</p>

                    <p>This project focuses on Huawei Cloud Console, the core portal for enterprise users to manage

                        interface with cloud architecture the potential pivot point for Huawei Cloud to surpass
                        competitors.</p>

                            console interfaces, even with AI, are static, passive, information overwhelming and still a
                            lot of manual effort / attention needed. Current conversational UI for AI is just not
                            sufficient.</li>
                        <li>In a future setting of agentic cloud, customers will meet amplified challenges of using and
                            trusting the system for cloud domain. Even when the agentic level is L4~5, human will find
                            it speculative and uncertain to work with.</li>

                    <p><strong>Mismatch between mobile constraints and full-feature ambition.</strong></p>
                    <p>The existing Huawei Cloud mobile console app was previously developed with a lot of mismatch from
                        how users use it in real scenario. With lowering satisfaction rate compared its wide coverage of
                        users, there is an organizational effort of bring up overall satisfaction rate and the app is
                        planned for a revamp.</p>

                    <p><strong>Problems:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Users are forced to operate cloud from tech stack perspective rather than business
                            perspective. This is due to technical development principle for a lot of cloud platforms
                            from history legacy. And with role repsonsibility less specified, people who op cloud are
                            not necessary cloud opes but application developers. They need a more natural angle.</li>
                        <li>The mobile app is positioned as a full-feature console on the go. This caused a mismatch
                            between real needs in mobile use cases.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Update IA and introduce an overarching concept to filter data on the front end via
                                tagging (front end tweak rather than backend revamp):</strong>

                                <li><em>Why:</em> Within given time, it is not feasible to update the entire system to
                                    project based , even though its value has buy-in from product team as well. So we
                                    need
                                    to think about workaround to let user "see" data from that view. It is a tricky way
                                    to make user onboard first while we are still working on bigger scope changes.</li>

                                <li><em>Solution:</em> We identified a common pattern (from alert to details, from
                                    details to related info) across users and use that as the foundation for updated

                    <h2>About the project</h2>
                    <p>I am among the very first group of designers working on IBM Bluemix (IBM Cloud) and all the 1st
                        party services on the platform. Dating back to 2014, IBM changed its direction to cloud and
                        cognitive computing, which resulted in a couple of significant products, Bluemix and Watson.</p>
                    <p>I joined in the PureApplication team at first working on softwares that enables easy app
                        orchestration and deployment with PureApp machines. Later as the cloud strategy goes, the team
                        joined a larger discussion on creating a service called Cloud Automation Manager where PureApp
                        and 2 other legacy products work together to provide a seamless, secure and compliant services
                        for multi-cloud. The project is code named "Project Orpheus".</p>

                    <h2>Problem and goals</h2>
                    <p>With the help of Enterprise Design Thinking (then called IBM Design Thinking), whole team kicked
                        off early project goal workshops with a larger group of roles and defined key roles in the new
                        product journey with their own focuses.</p>
                    <p>The core problems are the breaking connection with different products and the splitted work flow
                        for roles working with them. A lot of manual work and communications are needed to finally
                        deploy an application for certain business.</p>
                    <p>The 4-walls-long journey map we generated in workshop shed insights on users' top pain points and
                        with research on competitors like RightScale, VMware, we compared all experience touchpoints in
                        lifecycles. Then they are converged into 3 key product goals, internally we call them "Hills".

                    <h2>Ideation and creation</h2>
                    <p>2 teams of designers in US and China worked remotely into several user-story based groups. Using
                        tools like Mural.ly we created virtual to-be journey maps and ideated upon that. Then all the
                        prototypes went on Invision with research team helped out for feedback from sponsor users. Those
                        users are essentially well-connected clients from sales team.</p>
                    <p>Users don't get to feel the complicated product integration behind Bluemix dashboard and
                        designers' goal is to make them focus on their own responsibility, with the service providing
                        enough support for handing over work and orchestrate flows.</p>
                    <p>Based on this, we re-imagined experience from lifecycle perspective and worked closely with
                        product line managers to ensure feasibility. Leveraging the early version of Carbon Design
                        Systems, we quickly designed the service from Get started, Everyday use, to Manage and upgrade.
                        In later tests with clients, most felt satisfied with the overall smooth experience in one
                        place.</p>

                    <h3>Solving the "Last Mile" problem for crypto wealth.</h3>
                    <p>Despite the growth of digital assets, "off-ramping"—converting crypto to fiat for daily
                        spend—remains a high-friction, high-fee pain point. Users are often forced onto prepaid debit
                        cards with limited acceptance or clunky top-up flows.</p>
                    <p>imToken Card aims to disrupt this by offering a <strong>true credit card experience</strong> that
                        allows users to spend first and pay bills later with their crypto assets, bridging the gap
                        between Web3 wealth and the Web2 payment infrastructure (Mastercard/Visa network).</p>

                    <h2>2. Core Value Proposition</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>True Credit Model:</strong> Unlike market competitors (mostly prepaid debit), this
                            card offers pre-given credit limits, allowing for seamless usage without constant top-ups.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Crypto Bill Payment:</strong> Users settle their monthly statements directly with
                            crypto, effectively "spending" their assets without immediate liquidation at the Point of
                            Sale.</li>
                        <li><strong>Global Accessibility:</strong> Targeted initially at underserved Asian markets
                            (e.g., Mainland China users needing global payment rails) with a roadmap for global
                            expansion.</li>
                        <li><strong>Competitive Economics:</strong> Leveraging DCS partnership to offer fees lower than
                            or comparable to standard off-ramp solutions.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>3. Global Design Strategy</h2>
                    <h3>Strategy: "Trustworthy & Economic"</h3>
                    <p>In a market saturated with high-fee, unreliable "crypto cards," the design strategy focused on
                        building immediate trust and highlighting economic value.</p>

                    <h3>Strategic Principles:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Trustworthy:</strong> Visuals and copy that align with established banking standards
                            (Partnered with DCS/Mastercard) to reduce user anxiety about fund safety.</li>
                        <li><strong>"Easy" as a Benchmark:</strong> The UX must match or beat the simplicity of a
                            standard bank card. No complex "DeFi" jargon—just "Spend" and "Pay Bill."</li>
                        <li><strong>Resonating & Motivating:</strong> Using the UI to highlight the unique value of
                            paying with crypto (e.g., "You saved X fees today") and gamifying the tiering system to
                            encourage engagement.</li>

                                    assets (ETH, USDT, DUSD), making the "cost" tangible.</li>
                                <li><strong>Limit Order Payments:</strong> A pro-feature (roadmap) allowing users to set

                    <h3>Context</h3>
                    <p>A 0-1 initiative to launch the first <strong>Crypto Credit Card</strong> (not prepaid) for the
                        Asian market, enabling users to spend fiat instantly and settle bills later with crypto assets.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Trust & Legitimacy:</strong> Used premium, banking-standard aesthetics
                            (Metallic/Sleek) to signal "Credit" status vs. competitor "Prepaid" looks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Economic Motivation:</strong> Highlighted cost savings and "Limit Order" bill
                            payments to incentivize crypto usage over fiat.</li>
                        <li><strong>Frictionless Adoption:</strong> Designed a **Tiered KYC** flow for instant virtual
                            issuance, removing the 2-week physical card barrier.</li>

                    <h2>1. The Foundation: Token-centric Initiative</h2>
                    <h3>Design Rationales</h3>
                    <p>Starting from the internally aligned <strong>Token-centric initiative</strong>, the design was
                        driven by the core insight that "Tokens are a new data format" (comparable to text, images, or
                        video) carrying intrinsic value.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Tangibility ("Spatial" & "Physical"):</strong> To make tokens feel "real" rather
                            than just numbers on a screen, I adopted a "Can see, can touch, can feel" approach. This
                            involved exploring 3D and 2D visuals where specific shapes, geometries, and "uni-body"
                            integrations (combining company logo with token icons) give tokens a physical presence.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Visual Consistency for Identification:</strong> To help users navigate the millions
                            of available tokens, the design establishes a consistent classification system. By utilizing
                            shape, color, pattern, and animation, users can intuitively identify and distinguish between
                            different token types (Fungible, NFT, SoulBound).</li>

                            Link can also be easily made tangible in a variely of forms like NFC tag, QR code and more
                            blend in real life scenarios like red pocket or secret evenlope. This made tokens 0 barrier

                    <p>Lazada is the leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia with a user base of tens of millions.
                        Lazada Wallet is the built-in digital wallet that allows users to top up balance and bind
                        different financial assets to boost payment process and enjoy exclusive promotions.</p>
                    <p>But as the payment market in Southeast Asia is very fragmented, with almost more than 10 payment
                        methods in each country. And a large portion of users are not bank account ready, so they find
                        it hard to accept and enjoy the values by digital wallet.</p>

                        SEA markets. The overall proportion of wallet transaction is still very low so the most urgent
                        business need is to attract more users to activate and use it in daily shopping.</p>

                        to optimize Lazada wallet itself, we found that users just don't have enough awareness of it,
                        not to mention all the values that come with it:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The entry in as-is Lazada app for wallet is in a tiny space under "my" tab</li>
                        <li>Most existing users get to use wallet because of promotional message in home page banners or
                            noticing payment option in checkout</li>

                    <h2>Exploration and results</h2>
                    <p>We tried two design methods in parallel for visibility and functionality.</p>
                    <p>Firstly, we expose wallet entry with values for user education and attraction. All the values
                        came from previous research in each country and are specific tailored and configurable. Plus, a
                        dedicated animation is implemented carrying 3 different messages to stand out.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, we practiced and keep optimizing core payment experience with wallet. Shortened steps
                        for top up funds and then pay are now top up and pay directly. Even more, we inject payment
                        directly into checkout process, to make one-tap checkout possible in Lazada.</p>
                    <p>The final result turns out great. We saw numbers of orders placed with Lazada wallet DOUBLED
                        after 3 months.</p>

                        While the crypto ecosystem has matured, enabling seamless, regulatory-compliant payments for
                        everyday goods remains a complex hurdle. RIVO was conceived to build a ground-up crypto-native
                        payment network. The mission: allow users to pay directly in any asset while offering merchants
                        instant settlement in their preferred currency.

                    <p>Financial products are often dense and intimidating. I established a design language rooted in
                        <strong>Simplicity</strong> and <strong>"Stream-like" fluidity</strong>, aiming to make Web3
