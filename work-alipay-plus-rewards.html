                    <h2>About the project</h2>
                    <p>2020 was a devastating year for most people, with the covid almost blocking normal lives of
                        people. It was also terrible for most business, as offline transaction nearly dropped to zero
                        during lockdowns.</p>
                    <p>Alipay+ Rewards is a sub-brand of Alipay+, a global cross-border payment solutions that not only
                        ease transactions, but also boost and help merchants to better engage customer for sales. The
                        goal is to quickly launch sites within each partner local ewallets and gain active users.</p>

                    <h2>Problem and challenges</h2>
                    <p>For a new product targeting in other countries, though there are collaboration with roles based
                        there, the whole design team is based in Shanghai, China. No initial data, no user feedback, no
                        updated knowledge about local users behavior, even no access to local competitors for a lack of
                        local phone cards, and mostly importantly, no travelling to those countries during Covid for
                        research.</p>
                    <p>It is the worst working environment I can think of for a global design team. Hiring local
                        designers? We did not have the budget.</p>

                    <h2>Approaches</h2>
                    <p>My role in this project was a bit different from my previous ones, as I would be the one to
                        oversee the design team with my previous experience and connections working on pure payment
                        products in these countries.</p>
                    <p>Starting from breaking down all the pain points, I abstract all the elements needed for a good
                        localized design. These elements later became my core directions to solve the problems and
                        together they created a sort of "holographic" environment for design team to work in.</p>
                    <p>In the later stage, I managed to develop a working mode of working with local agencies in mixed
                        mode. To help free designers to some extent, with local designers in charge of part of the
                        design output/expressions, while design team in China act as the "brain" to input core design
                        structures.</p>

                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>The team successfully changed users mindset and impression of the brand by delivering an
                        intriguing promotion service to them. In the later built NPS system, we also see a prominent
                        rise in promoters.</p>
                    <p>Throughout 2021, we updated the home page of Alipay+ Rewards in each wallet, held a mega campaign
                        in 11.11, and established a brand with mascot that are acknowledged by millions.</p>
                    <p>Internally, I prepared the whole team a design work structure for any kind of overseas design in
                        the future. The connections that we used are all kept in our design library and later helped the
                        Alipay+ project in 2022.</p>
