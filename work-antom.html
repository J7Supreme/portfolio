                    <h2>About the project</h2>
                    <p>I worked in the International BU of Ant Group (Alipay), which provides payment solutions for its
                        affiliated Alibaba cross-border business, 2 of which I participated in are:</p>
                    <ul style="color: var(--text-p-grey); line-height: 1.6; margin-left: 20px;">
                        <li>Lazada: top e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, operates in 6 countries including
                            Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand</li>
                        <li>AliExpress: cross-border e-commerce platform in more than 100 countries, with major market
                            share in Brazil, Spain and Russia</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In the project, I set my feet in all local markets, utilizing localized user insights and
                        platform data to drive new and existing payment enablement.</p>

                    <h2>Background and goals</h2>
                    <p>Outside the credit card dominated world, 17% people worldwide and 67% in Southeast Asia are
                        unbanked. With e-commerce bringing products to them, the last connection before logistics is
                        payment. With vastly varied local financial environment and payment methods, Ant Group aims to
                        connect local users with their preferred payment experience.</p>
                    <p>These payment methods include: Cash on delivery, Store payment, Bank debit, Online banking,
                        E-wallet, Voucher payment, and more.</p>

                <section class="content-section-v2">
                    <h2>Challenges and approaches</h2>
                    <p>The team knew very little about local users' behavior and payment habits. With existing payment
                        methods suffering from low success rate, data itself cannot tell all the reasons for
                        improvement.</p>
                    <p>For each market and each payment method that I was involved, me and my team started by
                        understanding more about the country and users:</p>
                    <ul style="color: var(--text-p-grey); line-height: 1.6; margin-left: 20px;">
                        <li>E2E conversion rate break down and analysis for transaction</li>
                        <li>Regional demographic and ethnographic research and built country specific profile</li>
                        <li>Recruited users and conduct field research & in-depth user interview locally</li>
                        <li>Design sprint w/ users and internal stakeholders for journeys, pains and solutions</li>
                        <li>User validation with prototypes locally</li>
                    </ul>

                <section class="content-section-v2">
                    <h2>Deliverables and results</h2>
                    <p>The core design principles are based in the essence of payment, which is the TRUST from users.
                        The team worked hard to locate key LOCAL TRUST element in user experience and leveraged it to
                        connect users.</p>
                    <p>With that, I designed for more than 20 methods in more than 5 countries. In Philippines, I helped
                        upgrade Cash on delivery method in Lazada to ewallet option and increase its transaction by
                        5.01%. In Brazil, I optimized experience of Boleto method and increase its success rate by
                        4.01%.</p>
